At first glance, the effect of Aviation on climate change might seem negligible, but two of the ways air travel impacts climate change severely are the emission of carbon dioxide and the creation of high alt-altitude contrails (Williams, Noland & Toumi, 2002). As to how it can be prevented, reconfiguration of the airspace is a viable option. This can include vertical changes in the sectors to maintain appropriate density. Furthermore, reducing the maximum altitude of aircraft could also be considered as a viable option.
