Climate change is an issue that is described as a “cross-cutting issue addressed by all government officials” (Luis & Ian, 2013). If not dealt with now, in the future the problem will escalate, and humanity needs to adapt to the situation accordingly. Although most countries turn a blind eye to this catastrophic event, Mozambique is prepared by forming a group on climate change, aiming to support other smaller corporations on environmental issues. They already have the help of Française de Dévelopment (AFD), World Bank, DFID, and more. One way we can practice the planning of adaptation is sustainability. The concept of sustainability summarises into resource management, or in more complex terms, the maintenance of some entity over time, framed in the context of SESs. resource management is understood as “a concept with applications in broader social realms” (Nate Kauffman & Hill, 2021).
