Education plays a pivotal role in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13) by fostering Improved Climate Change Education (CCE). This educational approach heightens awareness of climate change mitigation, adaptation, and impact reduction, along with early warning systems. Particularly in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, CCE prioritizes building capacity in women, youth, and marginalized communities. Starting with Early Childhood Care and Education, learners connect with their natural environment through activities like forest and nature classes, cultivating gardening and plant-growing skills. This phase nurtures a curiosity to explore the world around them. Moving on to Primary Education, students gain a foundational understanding of climate science, encompassing concepts like the carbon cycle and the effects of greenhouse gases. They grasp the physical impacts, such as rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions, while becoming conscious of climate vulnerability. At the Secondary Education level, students delve deeper into mitigation and adaptation strategies, acquiring skills to monitor the environment and analyze results for informed decision-making. This empowers them to make sustainable choices in consumption patterns, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions, electricity use, and improved recycling behaviour. Overall, the integration of climate-focused education at different stages equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to contribute effectively to addressing climate change challenges and advancing SDG-13.
