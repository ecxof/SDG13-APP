In the earlier ages, catastrophic events were always a recurring issue, and due to their unpredictable nature, fear of humanity towards them seems reasonable. However, upon a deeper dive into this subject, we see that such events only occur when the earth reaches a critical tipping point. Looking back on the previous major catastrophic events might give us an early warning on climate change. “Extreme climate incidents in the past now become typical” (Travis, 2013). Meaning that we can learn patterns from previous disastrous events to prevent present and future similar events from happening.
