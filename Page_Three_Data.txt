SDG-13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its wide-ranging impacts, while SDG-3 aims to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all. The intricate link between climate and health is evident as actions in one realm yield results in the other. Climate change has spurred more frequent and intense extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and shifts in infectious disease patterns, with projections indicating these trends will persist, impacting both people and ecosystems. Anticipated consequences include increased migration, resource conflicts, and political instability, affecting the economic, environmental, and social determinants of health. The severity of these impacts hinges on factors such as exposure levels, personal characteristics (age, education, income, and health status), and access to crucial services. Immediate action is imperative, with the urgent need to nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to avert severe global consequences. While limiting temperature increases to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels remains feasible, achieving this goal demands significant advancements in technology, economics, institutions, and behavior. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions not only safeguards the planet but also yields immediate health, economic, and societal benefits by saving lives and curbing diseases. The substantial cost savings from health improvements resulting from emission-cutting policies underscore the urgent and interconnected nature of addressing climate change for the well-being of both society and the planet.
